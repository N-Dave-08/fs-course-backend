## Backend course project

This folder is reserved for the **complete reference project** for `fs-course-backend`.

- If you want to follow the course “progressive lessons” path, you can ignore this folder until the end.
- If you want to compare your work, use this folder as the “gold standard” structure for a production-ready Express API.

If you haven’t built it yet, start with the lessons in `level-01-express-basics/` and work forward.
